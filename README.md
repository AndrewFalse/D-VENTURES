## About the project
### Project topics: 
The project was created as part of a project activity at the university aimed at creating a telegram assistant bot whose task is to optimize and simplify the gameplay in the D&D tabletop role-playing game.

### Scale:
The project is aimed at the community of players in the role-playing game "Dungeons & Dragons", and since this game is now quite popular thanks to various shows and social networks, the telegram bot will get a wide scope.

### Project implementation period:
The deadline for the implementation of the project is set for May 29, 2023, the project was launched on March 15, 2023.

### Geography of the project:
Telegram bot "D&VENTURES" is aimed at the Russian audience and all CIS countries, it is suitable for any Russian-speaking user.

### Brief description of the project:
The project is an assistant both to simplify the process of playing "D & D". It includes a library on races, classes, subclasses, bestiary, spells, spells, backstory, items and potions. The creation of a character is provided for all game parameters, as well as a game field is implemented, with dice roll functions, changes in the health and armor of the character, with a field of notes, etc. The bot will help the user not to waste time on paperwork and fully enjoy the gameplay.

### Description of the problem/relevance of the project:
Anyone who has played D&D has come across the fact that most of the gameplay is spent on dice rolls (often they have to be thrown again), on recording the parameters of their player, on inventory records, on empty conversations about spells, as well as explaining the rules to new players â€“ all this is very distracting from and prevents you from fully enjoying the gameplay.

### Main target groups:
The target audience of the bot "D & VENTURES" completely coincides with the target audience of the game "Dungeons & Dragons", which varies from 14 to 40 years old, regardless of the gender of the player.

### Information support of the project:
At this stage, the project does not involve information support, but in the future, it is planned to work with the media, inform through social networks, websites, cooperation with shows and venues related to the game "D&D".
